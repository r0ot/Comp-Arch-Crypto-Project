The method does not require path enumeration and is not limited to the shortest paths or geodesies. We apply this measure to two examples: a network of homosexual men diagnosed with AIDS, and observations on a colony of baboons. Comparisons are made with ‚Äúbetweenness‚Äù and ‚Äúcloseness‚Äù centrality measures. The processes by which structural changes in networks occur over time are also discussed."

	The HMMs used in the ASAM tool model the time evolution of suspicious
	patterns within the information space gathered from sources such
	as financial institutions, intelligence reports, newspapers, emails,
	etc. Here we report our software's ability to detect multiple terrorist
	networks within the same observation space, distinguish transaction
	"signatures" of terrorist activity from the ambient background of
	transactions of benign origin, and incorporate information relating
	to terrorist activity, timing and sequence.},

	extensive database to date on social networks. By mapping the electronic
	database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science
	for an 8-year period (1991-98), we infer the dynamic and the structural
	mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex
	system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed
	characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover
	the topological measures that characterize the network at a given
	moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results
	indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution
	is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and
	external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions
	the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases.
	Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time
	evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting
	a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical
	simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could
	not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical
	results underline the important role internal links play in determining
	the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and
	methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network
	could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving
	networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other
	social networks.},

	and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement
	of similarity is preceded by 1) solving for correspondences between
	points on the two shapes, 2) using the correspondences to estimate
	an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem,
	we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape
	context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining
	points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization.
	Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape
	contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal
	assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate
	the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate
	splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this
	purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as
	a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with
	a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat
	recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the
	problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar
	to that in the image. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks,
	handwritten digits, and the COIL data set.},

  abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) warn of suspicious or malicious
	network activity and are a fundamental, yet passive, defense-in-depth
	layer for modern networks. Prior research has applied information
	fusion techniques to correlate the alerts of multiple IDSs and group
	those belonging to the same multi-stage attack into attack tracks.
	Projecting the next likely step in these tracks potentially enhances
	an analyst’s situation awareness; however, the reliance on attack
	plans, complicated algorithms, or expert knowledge of the respective
	network is prohibitive and prone to obsolescence with the continual

	This paper presents a real-time continually learning system capable
	of projecting attack tracks that does not require a priori knowledge
	about network architecture or rely on static attack templates. The
	intrusion projection system is framed as part of a larger information

	a comprehensive understanding of the security threats and existing

	providing a taxonomy of security attacks, which are classified into
	four main categories: DNS hacking, routing table poisoning, packet

	fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the
	total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness
	of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined.
	This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial
	and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where
	we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large
	number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity
	optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements

  abstract = { Intent inferencing is the ability to predict an opposing force's
	(OPFOR) high level goals. This is accomplished by the interpretation
	of the OPFOR's disposition, movements, and actions within the context
	of known OPFOR doctrine and knowledge of the environment. For example,
	given likely OPFOR force size, composition, disposition, observations
	of recent activity, obstacles in the terrain, cultural features such
	as bridges, roads, and key terrain, intent inferencing will be able
	to predict the opposing force's high level goal and likely behavior
	for achieving it. This paper describes an algorithm for intent inferencing
	on an enemy force with track data, recent movements by OPFOR forces
	across terrain, terrain from a GIS database, and OPFOR doctrine as
	input. This algorithm uses artificial potential fields to discover
	field parameters of paths that best relate sensed track data from
	the movements of individual enemy aggregates to hypothesized goals.
	Hypothesized goals for individual aggregates are then combined with
	enemy doctrine to discover the intent of several aggregates acting
	in concert.},

  abstract = {Shortly after proposing Dempster's rule of combination as a general
	aggregation rule for evidence from independent sources, Zadeh formulated
	an annoying example for which Dempster's rule seemed to produce counter-intuitive
	results. Since then, many authors have used Zadeh's example either
	to criticize Demster-Shafer theory as a whole, or as a motivation
	for constructing alternative combination rules. This paper shows
	that the counter-intuition of Zadeh's example is not a problem of
	Dempster's rule, but a problem of Zadeh's model that does not correspond
	to reality. Two different ways to fix the problem will be discussed,
	showing that Dempster's rule of combination perfectly behaves, as
	one would expect.},

	logical rules that are understandable for human. We believe that
	the interpretability of neural networks contributes to the improvement

	a sequence X1, ..., Xn drawn from a stationary mixing source, it
	predicts the next symbol Xn+1 based on selecting a context of Xn+1.
	The predictor, called the sampled pattern matching (SPM), is a modification
	of the Ehrenfeucht-Mycielski (1992) pseudorandom generator algorithm.
	It predicts the value of the most frequent symbol appearing at the
	so-called sampled positions. These positions follow the occurrences
	of a fraction of the longest suffix of the original sequence that
	has another copy inside X1X2···Xn ; that is, in SPM, the context
	selection consists of taking certain fraction of the longest match.
	The study of the longest match for lossless data compression was
	initiated by Wyner and Ziv in their 1989 seminal paper. Here, we
	estimate the redundancy of the SPM universal predictor, that is,
	we prove that the probability the SPM predictor makes worse decisions
	than the optimal predictor is for some as. As a matter of fact, we
	show that we can predict K=O(1) symbols with the same probability

	describing the suitability of maximal join for high-level information

	Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert
	knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. We describe a
	data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection
	(ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to
	extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection
	or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that
	accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities.
	These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection.
	New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through
	a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces
	a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models.
	We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification,
	meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes. We report
	on the results of applying these programs to the extensively gathered
	network audit data for the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation

	themselves (how much an attack would cause damage to the network),
	this approach assesses the attack threat from a forwarding perspective
	(how probable it would be the precursor of future attacks). First,
	to every attack type and some attack scenarios, their probabilities
	of having following attacks(PFAs) are calculated by a data mining
	algorithm. Then the threats of real time intrusions are assessed
	by these probabilities. The result of the threat assessment can help
	identify the intrusion alerts which would be the best evidence for
	the coming attacks from tremendous amount of intrusion alerts, thus
	this approach can be used for intrusion prediction. The approach
	is validated by DARPA 2000 and DARPA 1999 intrusion detection evaluation

	The best detection was provided by network-based systems for old

	for Solaris user-to-root (U2R) attacks. The best overall performance
	would have been provided by a combined system that used both host-
	and network-based intrusion detection. Detection accuracy was poor
	for previously unseen, new, stealthy and Windows NT attacks. Ten
	of the 58 attack types were completely missed by all systems. Systems
	missed attacks because signatures for old attacks did not generalize
	to new attacks, auditing was not available on all hosts, and protocols
	and TCP services were not analyzed at all or to the depth required.
	Promising capabilities were demonstrated by host-based systems, anomaly

	of Tarczynski and Allay by providing both distributional properties
	as well as rates of almost sure convergence for the simple random
	sampling scheme of Tarczynski and Allay. The primary focus is to
	consider and investigate the properties of a class of stratified
	random sampling estimates. We establish the statistical properties
	of the estimates, including precise expressions and rate of convergence
	of the mean-square errors. We also establish the asymptotic normality
	of the estimates useful for confidence interval calculations. Further,
	we optimize over the class of the estimates in order to obtain the
	best performance. In particular, we show that for functions with
	a first-order continuous derivative, the mean-square estimation error
	decays precisely at the fast rate of 1/N3. This rate is significantly
	higher than the rate of 1/N for simple random sampling estimates.
	The analytical results are illustrated by numerical examples. The

  abstract = {The problem of predicting the next outcome of an individual binary
	sequence under the constraint that the universal predictor has a
	finite memory, is explored. In this analysis, the finite-memory universal
	predictors are either deterministic or random time-invariant finite-state
	(FS) machines with K states (K-state machines). The paper provides
	bounds on the asymptotic achievable regret of these constrained universal
	predictors as a function of K, the number of their states, for long
	enough sequences. The specific results are as follows. When the universal
	predictors are deterministic machines, the comparison class consists
	of constant predictors, and prediction is with respect to the 0-1
	loss function (Hamming distance), we get tight bounds indicating
	that the optimal asymptotic regret is 1/(2K). In that case of K-state
	deterministic universal predictors, the constant predictors comparison
	class, but prediction is with respect to the self-information (code
	length) and the square-error loss functions, we show an upper bound
	on the regret (coding redundancy) of O(K-23/) and a lower bound of
	(K-45/). For these loss functions, if the predictor is allowed to
	be a random K-state machine, i.e., a machine with random state transitions,
	we get a lower bound of (1/K) on the regret, with a matching upper
	bound of O(1/K) for the square-error loss, and an upper bound of
	O(logK/K) Throughout the paper for the self-information loss. In
	addition, we provide results for all these loss functions in the
	case where the comparison class consists of all predictors that are
	order-L Markov machines.},

	issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach
	is the optimization of the quality function known as â€œmodularityâ€�
	over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity
	can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic
	matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that
	this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection
	that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing
	methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications
	to several published network data sets.},

  volume = {1},
  pages = {338-347 vol.1},
  abstract = {Effective mitigation of denial of service (DoS) attack is a pressing
	problem on the Internet. In many instances, DoS attacks can be prevented
	if the spoofed source IP address is traced back to its origin which
	allows assigning penalties to the offending party or isolating the
	compromised hosts and domains from the rest of the network. IP traceback
	mechanisms based on probabilistic packet marking (PPM) have been
	proposed for achieving traceback of DoS attacks. We show that probabilistic
	packet marking-of interest due to its efficiency and implementability
	vis-a-vis deterministic packet marking and logging or messaging based
	schemes-suffers under spoofing of the marking field in the IP header
	by the attacker which can impede traceback by the victim. We show
	that there is a trade-off between the ability of the victim to localize
	the attacker and the severity of the DoS attack, which is represented
	as a function of the marking probability, path length, and traffic
	volume. The optimal decision problem-the victim can choose the marking
	probability whereas the attacker can choose the spoofed marking value,
	source address, and attack volume-can be expressed as a constrained
	minimax optimization problem, where the victim chooses the marking
	probability such that the number of forgeable attack paths is minimized.
	We show that the attacker's ability to hide his location is curtailed
	by increasing the marking probability, however, the latter is upper-bounded
	due to sampling constraints. In typical IP internets, the attacker's
	address can be localized to within 2-5 equally likely sites which
	renders PPM effective against single source attacks. Under distributed
	DoS attacks, the uncertainty achievable by the attacker can be amplified,
	which diminishes the effectiveness of PPM},

  abstract = {The basic theory of Markov chains has been known to mathematicians
	and engineers for close to 80 years, but it is only in the past decade
	that it has been applied explicitly to problems in speech processing.
	One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains,
	have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for
	optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal
	patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately
	applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued
	refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling
	techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range
	of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial
	paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and
	to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.},

  abstract = {We consider a distributed approach to detect and to defend against
	the low-rate TCP attack (A. Kuzmanovic et al., August 2003). The
	low-rate TCP attack is essentially a periodic short burst which exploits
	the homogeneity of the minimum retransmission timeout (RTO) of TCP
	flows and forces all affected TCP flows to back off and enter the
	retransmission timeout state. This sort of attack is difficult to
	identify due to a large family of attack patterns. We propose a distributed
	detection mechanism which uses the dynamic time warping method to
	robustly and accurately identify the existence of this sort of attack.
	Once the attack is detected, a fair resource allocation mechanism
	is used so that (1) the number of affected TCP flows is minimized,
	and (2) we provide sufficient resource protection for the affected
	TCP flows. We report experimental results to quantify the robustness
	and accuracy of the proposed detection mechanism and the efficiency
	of the defense method.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in techniques for modeling, digitizing and visualizing
	3D shapes has led to an explosion in the number of available 3D models
	on the Internet and in domain-specific databases. This has led to
	the development of 3D shape retrieval systems that, given a query
	object, retrieve similar 3D objects. For visualization, 3D shapes
	are often represented as a surface, in particular polygonal meshes,
	for example in VRML format. Often these models contain holes, intersecting
	polygons, are not manifold, and do not enclose a volume unambiguously.
	On the contrary, 3D volume models, such as solid models produced
	by CAD systems, or voxels models, enclose a volume properly. This
	paper surveys the literature on methods for content based 3D retrieval,
	taking into account the applicability to surface models as well as
	to volume models. The methods are evaluated with respect to several
	requirements of content based 3D shape retrieval, such as: (1) shape
	representation requirements, (2) properties of dissimilarity measures,
	(3) efficiency, (4) discrimination abilities, (5) ability to perform
	partial matching, (6) robustness, and (7) necessity of pose normalization.
	Finally, the advantages and limitations of the several approaches
	in content based 3D shape retrieval are discussed.},

  abstract = {Nonuniform sampling can facilitate digital alias-free signal processing
	(DASP), i.e., digital signal processing that is not affected by aliasing.
	This paper presents two DASP approaches for spectrum estimation of
	continuous-time signals. The proposed algorithms, named the weighted
	sample (WS) and weighted probability (WP) density functions, respectively,
	utilize random sampling to suppress aliasing. Both methods produce
	unbiased estimators of the signal spectrum. To achieve this effect,
	the computational procedure for each method has been suitably matched
	with the probability density function characterising the pseudorandom
	generators of the sampling instants. Both proposed methods are analyzed,
	and the qualities of the estimators they produce have been compared
	with each other. Although none of the proposed spectrum estimators
	is universally better than the other one, it has been shown that
	in practical cases, the WP estimator produces generally smaller errors
	than those obtained from WS estimation. A practical limitation of
	the approaches caused by the sampling-instant jitter is also studied.
	It has been proven that in the presence of jitter, the theoretically
	infinite bandwidths of WS and WP signal analyses are limited. The
	maximum frequency up to which these analyses can be performed is
	inversely proportional to the size of the jitter.},

	protect digital assets. Alert correlation is essential to understanding
	the security threats and taking appropriate actions. This paper proposes
	a novel correlation approach based on triggering events and common
	resources. One of the key concepts in our approach is triggering
	events, which are the (low-level) events that trigger alerts. By
	grouping alerts that share "similar" triggering events, a set of
	alerts can be partitioned into different clusters such that the alerts
	in the same cluster may correspond to the same attack. Our approach
	further examines whether the alerts in each cluster are consistent
	with relevant network and host configurations, which help analysts
	to partially identify the severity of alerts and clusters. The other

	input resources are the necessary resources for an attack to succeed,
	and output resources are the resources that an attack supplies if
	successful. This paper proposes to model each attack through specifying
	input and output resources. By identifying the "common" resources
	between output resources of one attack and input resources of another,
	it discovers causal relationships between alert clusters and builds
	attack scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness
	of the proposed techniques.},

	We first discuss the fuzzy measure, describe its potential for characterizing
	relationships between multiple criteria, and introduce the class

	We then focus on the two fuzzy measures associated with the Dempster-Shafer
	belief structure, plausibility, and belief, and describe the types
	of ordered aggregation functions obtained using these measures. This
	leads us to introduce a new class of aggregation functions obtained

	Each component consists of a value, a subset of criteria and an agenda

  abstract = {Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they
	are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security
	(e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system.
	This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection,
	and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed.
	In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event
	transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and
	network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm
	profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities.
	The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability
	that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed
	activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive
	from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely
	the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks,
	and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms
	of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model
	of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data
	of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The
	robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is
	presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain
	technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential
	ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important
	role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain
	technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of
	normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique
	produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study
	also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is
	not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases,
	the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall,
	this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain
	technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection
	methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although
	it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test
	techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the
	Mill & Pascal data in this study.},
